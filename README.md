This is a small telegram bot I wrote for christmas that uses a large language model to allow you to chat to Santa Clause.

### Setup
Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Setup a .env file with the following contents
```
AI21_API_KEY=<YOUR-AI21-KEY>
TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY=<YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-KEY>
``` 

where the AI21 API key is obtained from [AI21](https://www.ai21.com/studio) and the telegram bot key by creating a telegram bot [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

Start the bot using `python main.py`
And that's it!
